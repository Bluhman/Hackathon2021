#Level synopsis
_Settled in the long-flooded forests, the Canid Tribes were forsaken ages ago by the standard kin of man due to their worship of wild spirits. They have since diverged wildly from humanity, delving into cruel magic to twist themselves into brutish, powerful forms._

This is a basic intro level that will pit the player, with basic stats, up against the __Canid Tribes__, who have taken them and another person hostage. It's up to you to find your way out, collect memories, and get past the dangerous canid general, __Bone Biter Melburns__.

##Key to the map:
* __BROWN BLOCKS:__ This is terrain. It's impassible, you can stand on it, and it's useful and sturdy.
*__YELLOW BLOCKS:__ This is platforms that can be passed through by crouching, then jumping. Used mainly as thin floors for stuff such as planks or ladder rungs.
Most of the other stuff on the map is badly drawn representations of stuff. To explain some of the symbols:

__Checkpoint/MemoryGate:__ These are the "bonfires" of this game. If you die, you respawn at one of these, and resting at one will restore all your HP, status, and will revive all enemies in the level. Later iterations of the game will let you teleport yourself back to the hub world and such to level up etc.
__Chest:__ It's got an item in it, and the name of what it is is displayed above it. For some chests, this might be a key or something else useful.
__Lever:__ Pull the lever, and it'll affect the map in some way, usually indicated with some arrow.
__Gate:__ These are solid platforms that can only be removed if you use the correct-color key on it.

__Blade:__ Carries a sword and shield, will block you if you attack blindly. Not aggressive, but they are reactive and focus on standing their ground and stopping you from getting through.
__Arrow:__ Shoots at you with arrows. If you get near, they usually will attempt to hop away rather than continue firing.
__Cloak:__ Swift and sneaky. These enemies can hop from platform to platform to follow you, but aren't very sturdy.
__Bone-Biter Melburns:__ The boss of the level. Weilds a big torch-hammer and likes impeding your process and burning bridges.
